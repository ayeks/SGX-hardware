# SGX-hardware list
This is a list of hardware which supports Intel SGX - Software Guard Extensions.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ayeks/SGX-hardware.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ayeks/SGX-hardware)

## Desktop

The CPU and the motherboard BIOS must support SGX. SGX is turned off by default and must be enabled via MSR.IA32\_Feature\_Control.SGX\_Enable. Only the BIOS can make changes to the IA32\_Feature\_Control.

### Desktop CPUs affected by the product change notification from 2015

Use the [ark.intel.com](https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors&SoftwareGuardExtensions=true) database to list all Intel CPUs that have the SGX feature.

Be cautious with the following 2015 i7,i5 and E3 CPUs. According to the [Product Change Notification](http://qdms.intel.com/dm/i.aspx/5A160770-FC47-47A0-BF8A-062540456F0A/PCN114074-00.pdf) from October 1, 2015. Only the listed CPUs with the following S-Spec Numbers are able to execute SGX instructions. For all other CPUs the Intel CPU database should be correct.

### CPUs without Platform Service Enclave functionality

As per the last comment on this [thread](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-software-guard-extensions-intel-sgx/topic/737881), Intel Xeon E3 processors as of today (Jul. 2017) do not have an Intel Management Engine. Therefore, the kernel will never be able to expose the device `/dev/mei0`.  What this means in terms of SGX is that Trusted Platform Service Functions (monotonic counters, trusted time) are not available on Xeon E3.

The following sgx_tservice functions are not available:

```
    sgx_create_pse_session
    sgx_close_pse_session
    sgx_get_ps_sec_prop
    sgx_get_trusted_time
    sgx_create_monotonic_counter_ex
    sgx_create_monotonic_counter
    sgx_destroy_monotonic_counter
    sgx_increment_monotonic_counter
    sgx_read_monotonic_counter
```
@lacabra discussed a workaround in [issue 43](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware/issues/43):

> ... And while not ideal, you can circumvent these, so you can arguably have fully capable SGX instances: you should be able to open a TLS connection to an NTP server you trust from within the enclave to obtain a source of trusted time. If you think of trusted monotonic counter as an instance of trusted time, you could get both using the same mechanism (these are suggestions from an Intel SGX architect).

## Hardware with out-of-the-box SGX support

Newer devices have out of the box SGX BIOS support. Sometimes it is mentioned in their documentation. If you have a newer device and see SGX in the BIOS, message me so I can add the device to the list.
If you need a SGX capable server have a look at the [Intel SGX server block](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/data-center-blocks/business/sgx-server-blocks.html). It consists of a complete server with Xeon processor, ram, mainboard and drives. Driver issues should't be a problem.

## Hardware with SGX2 support

It seems that Intel [Gemini Lake](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/codename/83915/gemini-lake.html) processors support SGX2. We will list the confirmed devices here as soon as they get reported.

## Cloud Vendors

Packet.net, IBM and Alibaba have Bare Metal Instances available that allow the execution of SGX instructions to create secure enclaves in the cloud. See [IBM Cloud Bare Metal Instances](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/bluemix/2018/05/data-use-protection-ibm-cloud-using-intel-sgx/) and [Alibaba ECS Bare Metal Instance](https://www.alibabacloud.com/product/ebm). If you were able to experiment with SGX in the Cloud, please let us know!

Both [AWS](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware/issues/37) and [Google](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware/issues/38) have CPUs that capable of SGX but the execution is disabled. We discussed that into detail [here](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware/issues/37). According to a [Intel forum post](https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-software-guard-extensions-intel-sgx/topic/755636).

## Device with a SGX CPU, but no BIOS support

The following devices have a SGX capable CPU included, but don't have the required BIOS settings. So you cannot execute SGX instructions on those devices. **Do NOT buy for SGX development:**

## Compile `test-sgx`

You can check if SGX is enabled on you system with `test_sgx.c`. Just compile and run it:

- Linux / gcc 13.1

```bash
gcc -Wl,--no-as-needed -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -masm=intel -o test-sgx -lcap cpuid.c rdmsr.c xsave.c vdso.c test-sgx.c
```

- Windows 11 / Visual Studio 2022 (x64 Native Tools)

```bash
cl test-sgx.c cpuid.c rdmsr.c xsave.c vdso.c
```

- MacOS / Clang 15

```bash
clang -Wall -Wextra -Wpedantic -masm=intel -std=c2x -Wno-gnu-binary-literal -o test-sgx cpuid.c rdmsr.c xsave.c vdso.c test-sgx.c
```

See [Issue 17](https://github.com/ayeks/SGX-hardware/issues/17) for the execution in Visual Studio.

That means that you are now able to call the special SGX calls of your CPU.
However you will always need the official Intel SGX Drivers including their
Launch Enclave to initiate your own enclaves.  To be able to execute SGX
functions you need both `Supports SGX` and `SGX[1|2] leaf instructions (SGX[1|2]): 1`.

Another hint that SGX functions are working is the output of an enclave size
eg. `The maximum supported enclave size` is set.
